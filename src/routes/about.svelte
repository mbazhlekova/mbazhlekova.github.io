      Hi, I'm Maria! I'm a software engineer from Bulgaria ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ living in
      Portland, OR ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in coding started in the days of MySpace when I learned I
      could edit the HTML & CSS to have the coolest looking page. I followed
      this interest all the way to college where I studied Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked in different parts of the stack and get just as excited to
      create user friendly interfaces as resilient services.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really enjoy being a constant beginner and learning new things. These
      days I'm focused on deeply understanding functional programming with
      Elixir and exploring new front-end frameworks like Svelte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, you can find me exploring the Pacific Northwest with my
      family, babying the plants in my garden, playing a board game, reading a
      comic book or working on a new sewing project.
