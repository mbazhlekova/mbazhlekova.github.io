        Hi, I'm Maria! I'm a software engineer from Bulgaria ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ living in
        Portland, OR ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in coding started in the days of MySpace when I learned I
        could edit the HTML & CSS to have the coolest looking page. I followed
        this interest all the way to college where I studied Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked in different parts of the stack and get just as excited to
        create user friendly interfaces as resilient services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoy being a constant beginner and learning new things. These
        days I'm focused on deeply understanding functional programming with
        Elixir and exploring new front-end frameworks like Svelte.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, you can find me exploring the Pacific Northwest with my
        family, babying the plants in my garden, playing a board game, reading a
        comic book or working on a new sewing project.
      </p>
