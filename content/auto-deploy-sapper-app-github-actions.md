Recently, I decided to update my personal website and blog. I like to learn new things through personal projects so I decided to use [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), a server-side rendered framework for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

After building my Sapper blog, I deployed it to GitHub Pages manually by running a script to push the compiled code to the branch deployed on my GitHub Pages site. But there were a few times when I forgot to deploy changes and found the manual process cumbersome. Enter GitHub Actions.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions allow you to automate parts of your workflow directly from GitHub. Setting up a GitHub Action to automatically deploy changes to your Sapper app to GitHub Pages is really easy!

To create a build and deploy actions, first you'll need to generate a Personal Access Token and save it in your secrets.

Go [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to generate a token

The go to your repository, select **'Settings'** and then **'Secrets'** from the left hand menu. There you can store the token you just created. I went with 'GITHUB' as the name for my secret but you can name it whatever you want.

Next create a `.github` directory in your project and in it a `workflows` directory with a `main.yml` file.

Here's the script to copy into the main.yml file:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop # Replace with name of your main branch
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Use Node.js '12.x'
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: "12.x"
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run export
      - name: Build and Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
        with:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB }}
          BRANCH: master # Replace with name of branch deployed to GH Pages
          FOLDER: __sapper__/export
```

A few things to note, I work off the `develop` branch and have `master` deployed to GitHub Pages. In the above script, replace the values with your branch names.

And that's it! ðŸŽ‰ Now when you push changes to your main branch, they'll automatically be deployed to GitHub Pages.
